Saturn
Saturn SDR project FPGA amd other files This repository holds the source for the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA created using Vivado

Current version create using Vivado 2023.1; you must use the same version of vivado.

The file structure is:

FPGA FPGA design files linuxdriver source files for the device driver, patched from Xilinx AR65444 project_documentation overall project level documentation hardware releasable information about the Saturn hardware (note the design is not open source) sw_projects software projects for Saturn sw_tools software tools including debugging tools testing project test resources desktop desktop shortcuts to application files scripts shell scripts to update applications rules udev rules files

autostart files desktop entry files for autostarting programs in later Linux releases

FPGA\sources -coefficientfiles .COE files for FIR filter coefficients and CW keyer ROM -verilogmodules various IP modules -wrapper holds the HDL wrapper for the block design

FPGA\constraints holds the .XDC constraint files

FPGA\create_saturn_project.tcl script to recreate the project

This script is not relocatable. We recommend you use the same directory structure we use. The TCL script will need to be edited if not. open it in path: c:/xilinxdesigns/Saturn/FPGA (case sensitive!)

To use this repository:

Install vivado 2023.1
Copy this repository to c:\xilinxdesigns\saturn
Open vivado and find the TCL command line
type: cd c:/xilinxdesigns/Saturn/FPGA
type: source create_saturn_project.tcl
A new xilinx project will be created in the subdirectory FPGA\saturn_project if all goes well, select "generate bitstream" an the FPGA will be built
